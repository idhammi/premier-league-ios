After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley Stadium), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later, they received the council's approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Arsène Wenger described this as the \"biggest decision in Arsenal's history\" since the board appointed Herbert Chapman. Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. Emirates was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. The entire stadium project was completed in 2006 at a cost of £390 million. The club's former stadium was redeveloped as Highbury Square, an apartment complex.\r\n\r\nThe stadium has undergone a process of \"Arsenalisation\" since 2009 with the aim of restoring Arsenal's heritage and history.

It is the home ground of Premier League side Burnley Football Club, who have played there since moving from its Calder Vale ground in 1883. The stadium, which is situated on Harry Potts Way, named so after the club's longest serving Manager, has a capacity of 21,401, all seated. It was one of the last remaining stadiums in England to have the players' tunnel and dressing rooms behind one of the goals, until it was covered for seating in time for the 2014-15 Premier League season and rebuilt between the David Fishwick and James Hargreaves stand. The ground originally consisted of just a pitch and the first grandstand was not built until 1885. Six years after this, the \"Star\" stand was erected and terracing was later added to the ends of the ground. After the Second World War, the stadium was redeveloped with all four stands being rebuilt. During the 1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when the Longside and Bee Hole End terraces were replaced by all-seater stands. Currently, the four stands at Turf Moor are the James Hargreaves Stand, the Jimmy McIlroy Stand, the Bob Lord Stand and the Cricket Field Stand.\r\n\r\nBurnley played their first match at the ground on 17 February 1883, losing 3–6 to local side Rawtenstall. When Prince Albert Victor opened a new hospital in Burnley in 1886, Turf Moor became the first football ground to be visited by a member of the British Royal Family. The first Football League match at the ground took place on 6 October 1888, with Fred Poland scoring the first competitive goal at the stadium. The record attendance at Turf Moor was set in 1924 when 54,755 people attended an FA Cup tie between Burnley and Huddersfield Town. In the same year, Turf Moor hosted its only FA Cup semi-final to date. In 1927, the stadium was the venue of an international match between England and Wales. Since then, the ground has been used to host matches in the European Under-19 Championship and European Under-21 Championship fixtures.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, plans for expansion of Turf Moor were released to the public. The Burnley directors proposed a major development of the stadium, costing £20 million. The plans, which would incorporate the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand and the moving of the players' entrance tunnel, have been put on hold until the current financial climate improves. In 2009, following Burnley's promotion to the Premier League, the development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was announced. Director Paul Fletcher stated that the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor would eventually be 28,000 to cope with extra fans. However following the club's relegation from the Premier League in 2010, these plans were put on hold indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAfter again achieving promotion to the Premier League in 2014 further Ground renovations were undertaken to comply with new regulations include housing for International Media, relocation of the players tunnel and upgrades to seating in the David Fishwick Stand for away supporters. On 26 June 2014 the club unveiled a planning application for extensions to the Turf Moor front entrance including the rebuilding of the official Club Shop containing a first floor museum.","strStadiumLocation":"Harry Potts Way, Burnley, Lancashire","intStadiumCapacity":"21401","strWebsite":"www.burnleyfootballclub.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/officialburnleyfc","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/burnleyofficial","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/burnleyofficial","strDescriptionEN":"Burnley Football Club \/ˈbɜrnli\/ are a professional football club based in Burnley, Lancashire, who play in the Premier League, the highest level of English football.

The stadium (designed by Scottish stadium architect Archibald Leitch) was constructed by Humphreys of Kensington (a firm regularly used by Leitch) for around £30,000, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of London on 30 August 1924. There was then only one stand (the present Main Stand), but this was unfinished due to industrial action; Crystal Palace played Sheffield Wednesday and lost 0–1 in front of 25,000 fans.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1926, England played Wales in an international at the stadium. England amateur matches and various other finals were also staged there, as were other sports including boxing, bicycle polo (in the late 1940s) and cricket and music concerts (in the 1980s). In addition to this, it hosted two games for the 1948 Summer Olympics.\r\n\r\nIn 1953, the stadium's first floodlights were installed consisting of numerous poles around the 3 sides of terracing and four roof mounted installations on the Main Stand, but were replaced nine years later by floodlights mounted on, pylons in each corner and six installations on the Main Stand roof.

They currently play in the highest level in English football, the Premier League. Since 1964, the club have mostly played in the top two leagues of English football. The club was founded in 1905 at the site of the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium, who wanted their own team to play at the historic venue. Palace applied to be elected to The Football League, but this was rejected and they instead joined the Southern Football League Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club's initial nickname, \"The Glaziers\". Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the Football League Third Division. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the Second Division, where they spent four seasons before suffering relegation to the Third Division South. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of Division Four. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching the First Division in 1969, and staying in the top division for four seasons before suffering successive relegations. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to \"The Eagles\" and ending the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with promotions in 1977 and 1979, the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two Champions. The period between 1989–91 was a successful time for the club. They reached an FA Cup Final in 1990, won the Full Members Cup in 1991, and achieved third place in the top division in the 1990–1991 season. Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club then achieved promotion back to the Premier League three times in 1994, 1997 and 2004, but each time suffered relegation at the end of the following season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club were promoted back to the Premier League with a 1–0 win over Watford in the Football League play-offs in May 2013.\r\n\r\nCrystal Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the First World War saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest. Since 1924, Palace have played their home games at Selhurst Park. Their home colours are red and blue vertical stripes, though prior to 1973 they wore claret and pale blue after the fashion of Aston Villa. They have a fierce rivalry with M23 neighbours Brighton & Hove Albion, with whom they have contested the M23 derby 98 times and also enjoy a strong rivalry with fellow South London team Millwall. The club's kit is currently made by Macron, and the shirt sponsor is Neteller. The club captain is Mile Jedinak and the current player of the year is Julian Speroni. Edmund Goodman is the club's longest serving manager, and Jim Cannon has made the most appearances for the club. Peter Simpson is the club's top scorer for both one season and overall, netting 54 and 165 respectively.

Goodison has hosted the maximum number of league games since the Premier League was formed in 1992, as Everton have remained in the top tier of English football since 1954.

The record for the highest attendance in women's football was set at Goodison Park in 1920, which stood for 92 years until 31 July 2012. This game's high attendance resulted in women's football being banned by the Football Association for 50 years as they felt it threatened the men's game.\r\n\r\nGoodison Park was conceived in unusual circumstances: two factions of politicians on the Everton board grappled to control the destiny of the club.

El United nombró a Matt Busby como entrenador del equipo tras la guerra y su política, por entonces inaudita, de la promoción de la mayor parte de los jugadores del equipo juvenil del club tuvo un gran éxito, al ganar la liga en 1956 y 1957.9 Este éxito tuvo un alto en el camino con el desastre aéreo de Múnich de 1958, en el que ocho jugadores del equipo perdieron la vida.10 11 A pesar de dicha tragedia, el conjunto supo recuperarse y ganó la liga en 1965 y 1967, así como la Copa Europea en 1968. El club no tuvo de nuevo un éxito tan notable hasta la década de 1990, cuando Alex Ferguson dirigió al equipo a la obtención de ocho campeonatos ligueros en once años. En 1999, el Manchester United se convirtió en el primer equipo inglés en ganar la Champions, la Premier League y la FA Cup en la misma temporada —el «triplete» del club—.12\r\n\r\nEntre sus principales logros a nivel nacional se encuentran haber ganado la First Division\/Premier League en 20 ocasiones, la FA Cup en 11 y la Supercopa de Inglaterra en 20, récords absolutos en los tres casos, además de cuatro ediciones de la Copa de la Liga de Inglaterra. A nivel europeo, ha obtenido tres veces la Liga de Campeones, empatado en séptimo lugar y segundo mejor inglés, además de una Recopa de Europa.13 Es el único club inglés en convertirse en campeón mundial de clubes, al conquistar la Copa Intercontinental en 1999 y la Copa Mundial de Clubes de la FIFA en 2008, tras derrotar a los entonces campeones de América Palmeiras y Liga de Quito, respectivamente.\r\n\r\nLos principales rivales del Manchester United han sido el Liverpool y Manchester City, a quien se enfrenta en el derby de Manchester.\r\n\r\nEn la cultura popular, es considerado como uno de los más populares del mundo,14 debido a que cuenta con 659 millones de seguidores a nivel internacional hasta mayo de 2012, según una investigación realizada por la empresa Kantar. De esta cifra, 325 millones provienen del continente asiático, 173 millones del Oriente Medio y África, 90 millones de Europa y finalmente 71 millones de América. De igual manera, ha tenido el promedio de asistencia más alto en el fútbol inglés desde 1957, salvo algunas excepciones en que ha sido superado por el Tottenham, Everton y Liverpool.17\r\n\r\nFinancieramente, el United se convirtió en el primer equipo deportivo en superar un valor de 3 000 millones USD, para ser catalogada de esta forma como la franquicia deportiva mejor valuada del mundo, de acuerdo a la revista Forbes, un hito que sería superado un par de meses después por el también club de fútbol Real Madrid, con un valor de 3 300 millones USD. Hay que señalar que el club inglés encabezaba el listado de los equipos de fútbol más valuados del mundo desde 2004.","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/xzqdr11517660252.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/17ex4k1599928887.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/rwwxyv1421429574.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wtquqy1424229431.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/rxsyvv1420244538.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qxxsxu1424229449.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/quuytw1424229564.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/ho5bnw1594284456.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC6yW44UGJJBvYTlfC7CRg2Q","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134777","idSoccerXML":"8","idAPIfootball":"34","intLoved":"1","strTeam":"Newcastle","strTeamShort":"NEW","strAlternate":"Newcastle United","intFormedYear":"1892","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English Premier League","idLeague":"4328","strLeague2":"FA Cup","idLeague2":"4482","strLeague3":"EFL Cup","idLeague3":"4570","strLeague4":"","idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":"","idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":"","idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":"","idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"St James Park","strKeywords":"The Magpies","strRSS":"http:\/\/www.football365.com\/newcastle-united\/rss","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/ywsxxp1420245335.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"St James' Park is an all-seater stadium in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.

In April 2021, Watford were promoted back into the Premier League having spent just one season in the Championship.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rsuswy1448813519.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/x58uha1604434001.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/bpt0h61549381309.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/2v1wyv1504211409.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/22o4v81504211424.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/3lgh4y1504211456.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/pwcdb51504211469.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/wkqog41504211483.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCptKljTrbdMTgmuekGKhRug","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133636","idSoccerXML":"43","idAPIfootball":"48","intLoved":"2","strTeam":"West Ham","strTeamShort":"WHU","strAlternate":"West Ham United","intFormedYear":"1895","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English Premier League","idLeague":"4328","strLeague2":"FA Cup","idLeague2":"4482","strLeague3":"EFL Cup","idLeague3":"4570","strLeague4":"","idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":"","idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":"","idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":"","idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"London Olympic Stadium","strKeywords":"The Irons, The Hammers","strRSS":"http:\/\/www.football365.com\/west-ham\/rss","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/pgeutx1549800746.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"London Stadium (formerly and also known as Olympic Stadium and The Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park) is a multi-purpose outdoor stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in the Stratford district of London. It is located in the Lower Lea Valley, 6 miles (10 km) east of central London. It was originally constructed for the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics—serving as the track and field venue, and as the site of their opening and closing ceremonies. Following the Games, the stadium was subsequently renovated as a multi-purpose stadium, with its primary tenant becoming West Ham United F.C.\r\n\r\nLand preparation for the stadium began in mid-2007, with the official construction start date on 22 May 2008. The stadium held its first public event in March 2012, serving as the finish line for a celebrity run organised by the National Lottery. Holding 80,000 for the Olympics and the Paralympics, the stadium re-opened in July 2016 with a capacity of 60,000. The decision to make West Ham United the main tenants was controversial, with the initial tenancy process having to be rerun.\r\n\r\nThe stadium hosted several 2015 Rugby World Cup matches, two England rugby league Test matches, and the 2017 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and 2017 World Para Athletics Championships (the first time both events had been held in the same location in the same year). The stadium can also hold concerts with up to 80,000 spectators, and, due to its oval shape and relocatable seating, was deemed to potentially be suitable for other sporting events such as baseball and cricket.","strStadiumLocation":"Green Street, Upton Park, London","intStadiumCapacity":"60000","strWebsite":"www.whufc.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/westhamunitedofficial","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/whufc_official","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/westham","strDescriptionEN":"West Ham United Football Club is an English professional football club based in Upton Park, East London, England currently playing in the Premier League, England's top tier of football. The club was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. In 1904 the club relocated to their current Boleyn Ground stadium. They initially competed in the Southern League and Western League before eventually joining the full Football League in 1919 and subsequently enjoyed promotion to the top flight for the 1923 season. 1923 also saw the club feature in the first FA Cup Final to be held at Wembley against Bolton Wanderers.\r\n\r\nIn 1940 the team won the inaugural Football League War Cup. The club has won the FA Cup three times: in 1964, 1975 and 1980 as well as being runners-up twice, in 1923 and 2006. In 1965, they won the European Cup Winners Cup, and in 1999 they won the Intertoto Cup. They are one of eight existent clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 55 of 87 league seasons in Division 1 to 2013. However, unlike the other seven (Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur), the club has never won the league title. The club's best final league position is third place in the 1985–86 First Division.\r\n\r\nThree West Ham players played significant roles in England's victory in the 1966 World Cup final; captain Bobby Moore, and both goalscorers, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/yutyxs1467459956.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/71xfob1599929210.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/xwvstx1420900930.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/vvqwsp1420453111.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xwsrtu1420453178.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/spywry1420885041.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xvrwru1420885114.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/rrrxxr1424562643.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCCNOsmurvpEit9paBOzWtUg","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133599","idSoccerXML":"3","idAPIfootball":"39","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Wolves","strTeamShort":"WOL","strAlternate":"Wolverhampton Wanderers","intFormedYear":"1877","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English Premier League","idLeague":"4328","strLeague2":"UEFA Europa League","idLeague2":"4481","strLeague3":"FA Cup","idLeague3":"4482","strLeague4":"EFL Cup","idLeague4":"4570","strLeague5":"","idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":"","idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":"","idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Molineux Stadium","strKeywords":"Wolves, The Wanderers","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/xtvqvs1420753628.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Molineux Stadium (\/ˈmɒlɨnjuː\/ mol-i-new) is a Championship football stadium situated in Whitmore Reans, Wolverhampton, England. It has been the home ground of Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club since 1889, and has a long and illustrious history as the first 'new build' stadium in Football League history, one of the first grounds in the country to install floodlights, as well as hosting some of the first European club games in the 1950s.\r\n\r\nAt the time of its multi-million pound renovation in the early 1990s, Molineux was one of the biggest and most modern stadia in England, though it has since been eclipsed by many other ground developments. The stadium has however hosted England internationals and, more recently, England under-21 internationals, as well as the first UEFA Cup Final in 1972. Although currently a 31,000 seater stadium, the record attendance at Molineux stands at 61,315.\r\n\r\nInitial plans were announced in May 2010 to rebuild two sides of the stadium by the 2014–15 season to increase capacity to around 36,000. The first stage of this project began in Summer 2011 and was completed on course for the start of the 2012–13 season. There are also provisional future plans for a longer term redevelopment of every stand that could potentially create a 50,000 capacity.","strStadiumLocation":"Waterloo Road, Wolverhampton","intStadiumCapacity":"31700","strWebsite":"www.wolves.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/Wolves\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/wolves","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/wolves","strDescriptionEN":"Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club Listeni\/ˌwʊlvərˈhæmptən\/ (commonly referred to as Wolves) is an English professional football club that represents the city of Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. The club was originally known as St. Luke's FC and was founded in 1877 and since 1889 has played at Molineux. They currently compete in the Football League Championship, the second highest tier of English football, having been promoted from League One in 2014 after a solitary season at that level.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Wolves have been highly influential, most notably as being founder members of the Football League, as well as having played an instrumental role in the establishment of the European Cup, later to become the UEFA Champions League. Having won the FA Cup twice before the outbreak of the First World War, they developed into one of England's leading clubs under the management of ex-player Stan Cullis after the Second World War, going on to win the league three times and the FA Cup twice more between 1949 and 1960. It was during this time that the European Cup competition was established, after the English press declared Wolves \"Champions of the World\" following their victories against numerous top European and World sides in some of British football's first live televised games.\r\n\r\nWolves have yet to match the successes of the Stan Cullis era, although, under Bill McGarry, they contested the first-ever UEFA Cup final in 1972 and won the 1974 League Cup, a trophy they lifted again six years later under John Barnwell. However, financial mismanagement in the 1980s led to the club's very existence being under threat as well as three consecutive relegations, before a revival and back-to-back promotions under manager Graham Turner and record goalscorer Steve Bull saw them finish the decade in the Second Division, winning the Football League Trophy along the way.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/u9qr031621593327.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/neyyjx1599929254.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/wdes121532295945.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/p2xn8q1532295468.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/kzx8521532295383.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/3zzmow1532295430.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/co1ppu1532295499.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/vyxrss1462380950.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/officialwolvesvideo","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
